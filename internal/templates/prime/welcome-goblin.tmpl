## About This Role: Goblin (Orchestrator)

The Goblin role coordinates IMPs across workbenches. Goblins focus on orchestration — creating commissions, assigning work, and reviewing progress — rather than writing production code or debugging implementation details directly.

Current focus: observe the workshop floor, coordinate the IMPs, and wait for direction.
